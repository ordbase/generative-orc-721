Q: How can I generate a inscriptions.json dataset?


Let's try the  D.I.Y. Ordibots (w/ slug: diyordibots)
collection ...

Use / start with the [market/diyordibots.rb](diyordibots.rb) script ...

... that will auto-generate a filled-in basic skeleton
of an inscription.json dataset ...

... to run ... you must install the ruby machinery  (and the ruby package manager called rubygems ) ...

...  than get a copy of the repo - you can download as zip archive  or if you are a "power user" use $ git clone

...   to run the script use ...


    $ ruby market/diyordibots.rb


... that's it  ... that will get you   [market/diyordibots_inscriptions.json](diyordibots_inscriptions.json)   generated  (using the
[diyordibots/mint.csv](../diyordibots/mint.csv) &
[market/diyordibots_ids.csv](diyordibots_ids.csv) tabular datasets in the comma-separated values (.csv) format)


.. that's the basic skeleton ...

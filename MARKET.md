#  Generative ORC-721 Market Listings


Note:   the rule is
the deployer of the ORC-721 collection deploy text inscribe
has the option to "own" the
rights to the administration of the ORC-721 collection -
proof-able by bitcoin private/public keys -
all data for ORC-721 collections is 100% "on-chain" in theory -
if markets start to run indexer to collect and process the "on-chain" ORC-721 protocol data and image generation than ... it all happens "auto-magically" and decentralized ... SOON! ...

... for now to get ORC-721 collections listed on markets
requires the ORC-721 collection deployer or the collection community
to submit inscriptions.json datasets as such "by-hand"...


PS:  See [/market](market)  on public reference inscription.json datasets and scripts on how to (re)generate.

# Quick Commentary / Notes on Recursive Ordinals

tldr;  love recursive ordinals. LFG! let's make bitcoin magic again and change the bitcoin code, not the climate!   
Wen bigger?  Wen bigger L1 (layer 1) blocks?




> Q: u see these new recursive ordinals ?


only seen for now (not studied / read-up in detail) ...
 here's my blurb:    thanks for highlighting recursive ordinals ... looks great ... 
and great naming ... 
let's see what people do / come-up with using the new ordinal (recursive) machinery. love it. LFG! 
 let's make bitcoin magic again (and change the bitcoin code, not the climate)!


> Q: ya seems like there's a lot of similarities between the concepts of gen orc-721 and recursive ords

sorry - i haven't studied / read-up in detail about recursive ordinals  and haven't seen what people do use it for ... see above. 
PS: ORC-721 is generative NOT recursive ... 
so this might give generative  ORC-721 new recursive super-powers ...    for now i see it as 2+2 = 4

... reading-up - see https://github.com/ordinals/ord/pull/2174/files
 that looks like the upcoming documentation  about recursive  ordinals

PS: if anyone is interested in comparing apple & organges - 
here's the generative-ORC-721 docu -> https://github.com/ordbase/generative-orc-721


.. again as far as i can tell this is a better together world and not the classic maxi way - 
there only can be one. happy to hear your take.  
is recursive the new generative? or is recursive generative the new new?


... one more thing ... asked in the ⁠generative-orc-721  ... yes, "composability" or "recursive composites" will get added to ORC-721  SOON!   ... and more formats .. starting with vector graphics e.g. svg -    for on how NOT to do "composability"  
or "recursive composites" 
or such in generatives see CRC-721 -> https://github.com/kelvinink/crc-721 


.. by the way ... the biggest road block ahead on bitcoin ordinals is ....   the block size limit!  yes, make it bigger!    ordinals work because people want to store content on L1 (layer 1)!      sorry thinking out loud.  let the market decide - what data package has value - every package by definition is a sequened (long count) ordinal that you can trade (buy/sell) ...

... and  if i dare to say "smart contracts" are ded ...  why?
... hint: try to upgrade your "smart" contract ...  change the code ... ha ...
... if you store the data on L1 ... and than use an "off-chain" protocol .. than - guess what? - yes, you can upgrade the protocol  .... change the bitcoin code, not the climate! it is a protocol and not a "smart contract". 
... anyways, all i am trying to say is that ORC-721 is a protocol  ... happy to see "smart contract" stored on L1  using "recursive ordinals"  for generatives .   See above - and sure - all speculation and too early to tell. who knows.  by the way my tagline  on github is if you check  "no coiner having fun staying poor and wrong."


PS:   here's a joke about eth maxi to illustrate:

eth maxi:    i can deploy a token in 5 minutes [with "smart contract"]! 

bitcoin (ordinal) maxi:       hold my beer my friend ...
... 10 seconds later. done. 
i deployed 721 punks now!   no "smart contract" ...  see the one-liner inscribe here-> https://ordinals.com/inscription/753f663770d816f61acd35da8dd04e122eec8582e93ca36b2122f2d4ac206089i0        get your free mint.  cheers. prost! 




**Updates**

... reading-up ... this might be a new real-world recursive expirement to follow to learn & understand more about the new magic:

> Everyone in the Ordinals space should be paying attention
>  to what @OnChainMonkey is doing here.  
>  They've inscribe two npm packages fully on-chain onto Bitcoin which will be public goods 
>  that anyone can leverage to make fully on-chain, generative art similar to Art Blocks...

love it. LFG!  Wen D.I.Y. Punks by@OnChainMonkey?

PS:  anyways -  call my "old school" - i don't see the point of inscribing npm (javascript open source) packages ... there are public versions on the internets...  by the way ... microsoft has an artic vault of all github repos -> https://archiveprogram.github.com/arctic-vault/  
if anyone is worried, the code is going away ...   the website explains - 
How the cold storage will last 1000+ years   ... now please help me explain how bitcoin mining will work in 200 years ;-).


... a little public service announcement -   computer programming is a never-ending bug fixing odysee ... in the blockchain you inscribe data (and why not code? code is data!)  - no change possible -  sure - inscribe new versions (again and again and again and again and again...)  .... imagine if the bitcoin protocol is set in stone - than it's ded -  (hello bitcoin maxis ;-) - do you love the new ordinal kids on the block?)  -  change the (bitcoin) code, not the climate - see the point?  use upgradable "off-chain" protocols and store / inscribe the data "on-chain" forever unchangeable.

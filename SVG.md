# Quick Notes & Commentary on (Scalable) Vector Graphics (.SVG)


> I just created an on chain 3d rendering of my pixel pepe using recursive inscriptions. In the process, I inscribed  tooling that will be critical as we build out the bitcoinverse.  this is how i dit it - source: https://twitter.com/hbeckeri/status/1671917391377317891


here's a first quick answer / commentary:   for now ordgen / ORC-721  is bitmaps / .PNG  2D   ... support for new format - (scalable) vector graphics (.SVG) supporting 3D upcoming   BUT maybe in a week or two.
... another idea is the ordgen "on-chain" render than you can recurse in .SVG  and do the above ...
... if you want to do it NOW ... you CAN ... BUT you have to inscripe the generated image in 1x as .PNG.  it is your (extra) image so one more inscription needed.





## (Recursive) SVG Examples

... broken in recursive punk:

 add svg here


... improved formula in recursive noun punks:

 add svg here



...  now with rotation and transalte in recursive doodinals (rcsvio):

> Doodinals is the 1st collection of recursive arts fully created by the community.

> Doodle to your heart's content on http://RCSV.io,
> inscribe the generated SVG files on Ordinals,
> and your inscriptions have the chance to be included in the collection.

 add svg here

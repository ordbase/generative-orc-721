by [@TheInscriptor](https://twitter.com/TheInscriptor)

Step 1 - Assemble your Phunk here: https://ordbase.github.io/generative-orc-721/diyphunks

Step 2 - Copy the generated string, example:

    og mint diyphunks 0 11 37

Step 3 -  Use: https://looksordinal.com/index.html (or any preferred inscription service) to mint the token


IMPORTANT!  Keep the window open and focused after you make
the BTC payment for inscription until all the transactions
show up (you can mint more at once, recomended max is 10)
